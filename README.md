# For contributers

I haven't talked to you because i was busy<br>
here are the changes i was talking about

the first change is the struct used to store bignum_t instances.<br>
i have changes the array type to char because it's only holding numbers<br>
from 1 to 9 so it's going to waste memory< think but if you have your reasons you did that for sorry<br>

there are some other changes also if you have time look at them <br>
and also i have applied the 6 comparison operations. > < == != >= <= in a form of function<br>
you can look at them and also there is a test in the main.c file you can check it out and tell me<br>
if i've made any mistakes

and also i have some designe to the add and substraction implementation i'll will send you once  i finish it.<br>

you can compile it and try it.
```
gcc *.c
```

Thankyou !
